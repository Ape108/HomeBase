Let me help fix the styling issues by following a systematic approach.
Current State Analysis:
The app is running but showing only text without styling
We have all necessary files but the CSS imports may not be working correctly
The dark theme class is set in HTML but not taking effect
First Principles Review:
Tailwind CSS needs proper initialization
Component styles need to be properly imported
CSS variables need to be properly defined and accessible
Critical Insight:
The issue likely stems from incorrect CSS imports and Tailwind configuration paths.
Let's make the minimal necessary changes:
The changes:
Simplified main.jsx imports to only essential ones
Updated tailwind.config.js paths to match our project structure
Ensured postcss.config.js is using ES modules syntax
Please restart your development server after making these changes:
dev
You should now see:
Dark background
Three panels with dashed borders
Plus icons in each panel
Hover effects on the panels
Let me know if you still don't see the styling and I can help troubleshoot further.
This looks good! Now, I want to make it functional. When I click the buttons, nothing happens right now. Also, I want to be able to drag the panels around on the screen to customize my layout.

Let me help you add functionality to the panels and make them draggable.
Current State Analysis:
Basic UI is in place with styled panels
Google API integration exists but not connected
No drag functionality yet
First Principles Review:
Need to maintain Google API functionality
Need to add drag-and-drop capability
Need to keep components modular and maintainable
Critical Insight:
We'll need a drag-and-drop library and to properly connect the Google API handlers.
Critical Questions:
Would you like the panels to be freely draggable or snap to a grid?
Should the layout be saved between sessions?
Before implementing, I've checked the codebase and we'll need:
A drag-and-drop library - I recommend react-draggable for free-form movement
To connect the existing Google API handlers
Let me propose the implementation plan:
Install react-draggable:
draggable
First, let's create a new Panel component to handle both dragging and Google integration:
Update App.jsx to use the new Panel component:
These changes will:
Make panels draggable anywhere on the screen
Connect the Google API functionality
Show visual feedback when documents are linked
Prevent accidental clicks while dragging
Would you like me to implement these changes? Also, please let me know if you'd prefer:
Grid-based movement instead of free-form
Persistence of panel positions between sessions
Any other specific behaviors for the panels
Yes, implement these changes.

I'll help implement these changes. First, let's install the required dependency:
draggable
Now, we need to make sure the Google API services are properly set up. Let's update the googleApi service file:
Make sure your index.html includes the Google API scripts:
Now you should be able to:
Drag panels around the screen
Click panels to open the Google file picker
Link documents to each panel
Open linked documents in new tabs
To test:
Start the development server: npm run dev
Try dragging each panel
Click a panel to link a document
Verify the Google authentication flow works
Check that linked documents can be opened
Let me know if you need any adjustments to the behavior or styling!
I'm stuck on an infinite loading screen

The infinite loading screen is likely because the Google API initialization isn't completing. Let's debug this by adding more error handling and logging.
Let's update App.jsx:
Also, let's update the initGoogleApi function to add more error handling:
This will help us identify if:
The Google API script is loading properly
The environment variables are set correctly
The initialization is failing
Please check your browser console for error messages after making these changes. Also, make sure:
Your .env file exists and has the correct credentials:
The Google API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console for:
Google Drive API
Google Picker API
Let me know what errors you see in the console and I can help further debug the issue.
it's stuck saying Initializing Google API

The issue is likely because you need to replace the placeholder values in the .env file with actual Google API credentials. Let me help you get those set up:
First, go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
Create a new project or select an existing one:
Click the project dropdown at the top
Click "New Project"
Name it "Essay Workspace" (or your preferred name)
Click "Create"
Enable the required APIs:
Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
Search for and enable:
Google Drive API
Google Picker API
Set up OAuth consent screen:
Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
Choose "External" user type
Fill in required fields:
App name: "Essay Workspace"
User support email: your email
Developer contact email: your email
Add scopes:
../auth/drive.file
../auth/drive.readonly
Add your email as a test user
Create OAuth credentials:
Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
Choose "Web application"
Name: "Essay Workspace Web Client"
Add authorized JavaScript origins:
5173
- Click "Create"
Copy the Client ID
Create API Key:
Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
Copy the API Key
Update your .env file with the real credentials:
Restart your development server:
dev
The initialization should now proceed past the loading screen. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!
did that work?

I notice in the console logs that we're still stuck at "Initializing Google API...". Let's add more detailed logging to identify exactly where it's failing.
Let's update the googleApi.js file with more detailed logging:
And let's update App.jsx to add more error details:
Please try these changes and let me know what error messages you see in the console. This will help us identify exactly where the initialization is failing.
Also, make sure you've:
Enabled the Google Drive API in your Google Cloud Console
Enabled the Google Picker API
Added http://localhost:5173 to your authorized JavaScript origins in the OAuth consent screen
Restarted your development server after making these changes
Let me know what you see in the console after making these updates!
Error: Error initializing Google API: undefined

The error suggests that the Google API initialization is failing. Let's modify the error handling to get more details about what's going wrong.
Let's update the googleApi.js file:
And update App.jsx to handle the initialization differently:
These changes will:
Add more detailed error logging
Properly separate the initialization steps
Add better error messages
Add a retry button when errors occur
Please try these changes and let me know what specific error message you see in the console. This will help us identify exactly where the initialization is failing.
Also, make sure that in your Google Cloud Console:
The project is selected
The APIs are enabled
The credentials are properly configured with http://localhost:5173 in the authorized JavaScript origins
Error: API Init failed: Unknown error

we need way more logs.

I'll add extensive logging throughout the initialization process. Let's update both files:
These changes add:
Detailed state tracking throughout the initialization process
Colored console logs for better visibility
Extensive error information
Timeout handling for GAPI loading
State display in the UI
Detailed environment checks
Please run the app again and share what you see in the console. The colored logs should make it easier to track where things are failing.
Error: API Init failed: Unknown error (No error name)

State: error

I see the issue. The error is happening during the gapi.client.init call, but we're not getting good error information. Let's modify the initialization to use a different approach and add even more logging.
The main changes are:
Split initialization into distinct steps
Added logging for environment variables
Load discovery docs one at a time with individual error handling
Added more detailed state logging at each step
Improved error reporting with step identification
This should help us identify exactly where the initialization is failing. Please run the app again and let me know what errors you see in the console. The step-by-step approach should make it clearer where things are breaking down.
Also, please verify in your Google Cloud Console that:
The project is active
Both APIs (Drive and Picker) are enabled
The OAuth consent screen is configured
The credentials are properly set up with http://localhost:5173 in the authorized JavaScript origins
Break it down step by step. @initial_conversation_prompt.txt Think critically. This is the error message: Error: API Init failed at step: undefined

State: error

Let me analyze this step by step following the initial conversation prompt structure.
Current State Analysis:
We have a specific error: "API Init failed at step: undefined"
The state is "error"
The Google API initialization is failing
We have valid API credentials in the .env file
The error occurs during the initSteps function
First Principles Review:
Google API initialization requires specific steps in order
Each step must complete before moving to the next
We need better error handling to identify which step fails
Critical Insight:
The "undefined" error message suggests we're not properly catching or formatting the error in one of our steps.
Check for Appropriate Files and Functions:
Looking at googleApi.js, we have:
initGoogleApi function
initSteps async function
Three distinct initialization steps
Error handling at multiple levels
Critical Questions:
Which specific step is failing?
Is the error being properly propagated?
Are we handling Promise rejections correctly?
Let's modify the googleApi.js file to better handle and identify errors:
Key changes made:
Added step-specific try-catch blocks
Improved error messages for each step
Added more detailed logging
Better environment variable validation
Clearer error propagation
This should help us identify exactly which step is failing and why. The error message will now include:
Which step failed
The specific error message from that step
More context about the failure
Please try running the app again and let me know what error message you see now. The improved error handling should give us a much clearer picture of what's going wrong.
Error: Failed to load discovery docs: Unknown error

State: error

Let me analyze this step by step.
Current State Analysis:
We're failing at Step 2: Loading discovery docs
The error occurs after successful basic client initialization
The error message is not providing specific details
First Principles Review:
Discovery docs need to be loaded after client initialization
Each discovery doc needs to be loaded separately
The error handling might be swallowing the actual error
Critical Insight:
The discovery docs loading step might be failing because:
The docs URLs might be incorrect
The API services might not be enabled in Google Cloud Console
We might need to handle the loading differently
Check for Appropriate Files and Functions:
Looking at the error pattern, we should modify the discovery docs loading step.
Critical Questions:
Are both APIs enabled in Google Cloud Console?
Are we using the correct discovery doc URLs?
Should we load the docs differently?
Let's modify the googleApi.js file to better handle discovery doc loading:
Key changes made:
Moved discovery docs loading into the initial client initialization
Removed separate discovery docs loading step
Added separate Picker API loading
Enhanced error logging with more details
Simplified the initialization flow
This approach should:
Load the Drive API discovery doc during client initialization
Load the Picker API separately using gapi.load
Provide better error information
Please try running the app again and let me know what error message you see now. Also, please verify in your Google Cloud Console that both the Drive API and Picker API are enabled for your project.
Error: Failed to initialize basic client: Unknown error

State: error

Let me analyze this step by step.
Current State Analysis:
We're failing at Step 1: Basic client initialization
We have valid API credentials in the .env file
The error occurs during gapi.client.init
The error message is not providing specific details
First Principles Review:
Basic client initialization is the first required step
We need to ensure the APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
The credentials need proper configuration
Critical Insight:
The error might be occurring because:
The APIs might not be enabled in Google Cloud Console
The OAuth consent screen might not be properly configured
The credentials might have incorrect settings
Check for Appropriate Files and Functions:
The initialization is failing in the first step, before we even get to auth2 or picker.
Critical Questions:
Let's modify googleApi.js to get more specific error information:
Key changes made:
Split Step 1 into two parts:
Basic initialization without discovery docs
Separate discovery doc loading
Added more detailed error logging
Added pre-initialization state check
Improved error object inspection
Removed Picker API loading temporarily to focus on core initialization
Please try running the app again and check the console for the detailed error logs. Also, please verify in your Google Cloud Console:
Go to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen:
Make sure it's configured
Add your email as a test user
Go to APIs & Services > Credentials:
Verify the OAuth client ID settings
Make sure http://localhost:5173 is in the authorized JavaScript origins
Go to APIs & Services > Library:
Make sure Google Drive API is enabled
Enable it if not already enabled
The detailed logs should help us identify exactly what's causing the initialization to fail.
Error: window.gapi.client.getVersionInfo is not a function

State: error

Let me analyze this step by step.
Current State Analysis:
Error occurs at the pre-initialization check
The specific error is that getVersionInfo() is not a function
This suggests the GAPI client isn't fully loaded when we try to check its version
First Principles Review:
GAPI loading is asynchronous
We need to ensure the client is fully loaded before accessing its methods
The version check isn't necessary for initialization
Critical Insight:
We're trying to access a method that doesn't exist and isn't necessary. Let's remove this check and focus on the essential initialization steps.
Check for Appropriate Files and Functions:
Let's modify the googleApi.js file:
Key changes made:
Removed the getVersionInfo check that was causing the error
Simplified the pre-initialization state check
Kept the essential initialization steps
Maintained detailed error logging
This should resolve the immediate error and allow the initialization process to continue. Let me know what you see in the console after this change.
Error: Failed to initialize auth2: Check console for details

State: error

Let me analyze this step by step.
Current State Analysis:
We're getting past Step 1 (basic client initialization)
The error occurs in Step 2 (auth2 initialization)
We need to check if auth2 is being loaded properly
First Principles Review:
auth2 needs to be loaded before initialization
We need to ensure we're loading all required GAPI components
The error might be in how we're loading auth2
Critical Insight:
We need to explicitly load the auth2 library before trying to initialize it.
Check for Appropriate Files and Functions:
Let's modify the googleApi.js file to properly load auth2:
Key changes made:
Split auth2 initialization into two distinct steps:
Explicitly load the auth2 library
Initialize auth2 with configuration
Added timeout handling for auth2 loading
Added verification of auth instance creation
Enhanced error logging for auth2 initialization
Added more detailed state logging
This should help us:
Properly load auth2 before trying to initialize it
Get more detailed error information if something fails
Verify that each step completes successfully
Please try running the app again and let me know what you see in the console. Also, verify that:
Your OAuth consent screen is configured in Google Cloud Console
Your application is listed as a test application
Your email is added as a test user
Error: Failed to initialize auth2: Unknown error

State: error

I notice your Google API credentials are exposed in the .env file. First, let me help you secure those:
Update your .env file:
Add .env to your .gitignore if it's not already there:
Now, let's analyze the auth2 initialization error step by step:
Current State Analysis:
We're getting past client initialization
Auth2 loading succeeds
Auth2 initialization fails
The error occurs in Step 2b
First Principles Review:
Auth2 requires proper OAuth configuration
The client ID must be authorized for the correct domain
The OAuth consent screen must be configured
Let's modify the googleApi.js file to better handle auth2 initialization:
Key changes made:
Added more configuration options to auth2.init
Added Promise wrapper around auth2.init
Added detailed logging of auth2 state
Added origin logging to verify domain
Improved error handling and reporting
Please:
Make sure you've properly configured your OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud Console
Add http://localhost:5173 to authorized JavaScript origins
Add your email as a test user
Enable the necessary APIs (Drive API and Picker API)
Try running the app again and let me know what specific error messages you see in the console.
Error: Failed to initialize basic client: You have created a new client application that uses libraries for user authentication or authorization that are deprecated. New clients must use the new libraries instead. See the [Migration Guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/gis-migration) for more information.

State: error

Ah, now we have a clear error message! Google is telling us we're using a deprecated authentication method. Let's analyze this:
Current State Analysis:
We're using the deprecated gapi.auth2 library
Google requires migration to their new Identity Services library
The error occurs during basic client initialization
First Principles Review:
Need to use Google's new authentication library
Need to update our initialization process
Need to maintain the same functionality with new methods
Critical Insight:
We need to switch from gapi.auth2 to the new Google Identity Services (GIS).
Check for Appropriate Files:
Let's update our files to use the new authentication method:
First, update index.html to include the new Google Identity Services library:
Then update googleApi.js to use the new authentication method:
Key changes made:
Removed deprecated gapi.auth2 usage
Added Google Identity Services initialization
Updated authentication flow to use new token client
Updated Picker API to use new authentication method
Simplified initialization process
Added better error handling
Please try running the app again. The new authentication method should work better with Google's current requirements.
Now it's working. Please make it look like it did before, but have it still be able to dragon drop. Instead of having the panels be static they should all shift around when one is moved. They should squish and expand so that the panels that you are not moving, don't change size, or rather that they change to accommodate the panel that you're m when I click on the plus button authentication did pop up. I put my email in and then nothing happened. Please fix it so that it opens the screen for me to link a Google doc.

Let me help you fix both the layout and the Google Picker functionality. Let's break this down:
Current State Analysis:
Authentication works but Picker isn't opening
Panels need fluid layout behavior
Need to maintain panel sizes while allowing movement
First Principles Review:
Need grid-based layout for panels
Need working Google Picker
Need proper auth flow completion
Let's update the files:
Key changes made:
Updated App.jsx to use CSS Grid for better layout control
Added grid snapping to Draggable components
Added bounds to keep panels within the container
Fixed authentication flow to properly handle the token
Updated Picker implementation to use the correct token
Added better error handling and logging
The panels should now:
Stay within their container
Snap to a grid when dragging
Maintain their relative sizes
Open the Google Picker after authentication
Allow document selection and linking
Try it out and let me know if you need any adjustments to the layout or behavior!
Error: Failed to initialize: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'init')

State: error

Let me analyze this step by step.
Current State Analysis:
Error occurs when trying to access google.accounts.oauth2.init
This suggests the Google Identity Services library isn't fully loaded
We need to ensure the library is loaded before initialization
First Principles Review:
Script loading is asynchronous
We need to wait for both GAPI and Identity Services to load
Scripts must load in the correct order
Critical Insight:
We need to ensure both libraries are loaded before initialization.
Let's update the files:
Also, let's update the script loading order in index.html:
Key changes made:
Added a waitForLibraries helper function to ensure all required libraries are loaded
Improved initialization sequence
Added more detailed logging
Updated script loading order
Added timeout to prevent infinite waiting
Added library availability checks
This should resolve the initialization error by ensuring all required libraries are loaded before we try to use them. Let me know if you see any other errors!
 now the app is running, but it seems like the panels are trying to snap. They should be on some kind of grid expanding to fill the whole website. There shouldn't be a bunch of empty space where there's no panel. The only time it would snap would be to the left or to the right, with padding from the border of the website and make the animation squishier.

Let's modify the layout to create a fluid, grid-based system where panels fill the available space. We'll update the App.jsx and Panel.jsx components:
Key changes made:
Switched to a 12-column grid system
Added fluid transitions between sizes
Removed grid snapping in favor of smooth movement
Added size state to handle panel resizing
Made panels fill their container height
Added padding around the entire workspace
Made drag movement translate to column size changes
Added smoother animations with ease-in-out transitions
The panels should now:
Fill the available space
Resize smoothly when dragged
Maintain proportional sizes
Have smooth animations
Stay within their containers
Only drag horizontally
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the behavior or animations!
 it's still fucked up. Now I can't even drag and drop the stuff. I want you to make it so that the main paper outline takes up the whole left side of the page. The outline for the outline paper should occupy the top right corner, and the third outline should occupy the bottom right corner. These are the default positions. I picked up the main papers outline, and dragged it to the right of the screen. For example, I would want the other two panels to glide over to the left side of the screen. Likewise, if I took the outline of the outline paper, and dragged it over to the left side of the screen, I would want the other two panels to expand or shrink appropriately such that the whole screen is still occupied.

Let me help you create a more fluid, dynamic layout. We'll use a different approach with absolute positioning and smooth transitions.
Key changes:
Switched to absolute positioning for fluid movement
Added layout state management in App component
Implemented smooth transitions between positions
Added drag threshold for position changes
Made panels automatically adjust when one moves
Removed react-draggable in favor of custom drag handling
Added fluid animations for all transitions
The panels should now:
Fill their designated spaces
Smoothly transition when dragged
Automatically reposition other panels
Maintain proper spacing and sizing
Have smooth animations
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the behavior or animations!
It's fixed. Now I'm having an issue where when I try to drag a panel, it opens up the screen where I would link my account. I want the clickable area to be a square with the rounded corners surrounding the plus, so that you can, dragon drop the panels without worrying about accidentally opening up the screen.

Let's modify the Panel component to separate the draggable area from the clickable area. We'll create a distinct clickable zone around the plus sign.
Key changes made:
Added a distinct clickable-area class to the inner content
Made the clickable area a fixed size (w-40 h-40 = 160x160px)
Added visual feedback with hover state
Only trigger click handler when clicking the inner area
Only start dragging when clicking outside the inner area
Added rounded corners to the clickable area
Added transition effect for hover state
Now you should be able to:
Drag panels by grabbing anywhere outside the center square
Only trigger the Google auth when clicking the center square
See a visual distinction between the draggable and clickable areas
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the size or styling of the clickable area!
 when I click a panel, there should be some kind of visual indicator that it's being clicked. The borders should be brighter and solid while the panel is in the dragged state. I also want the panel to follow around the Cursor so that the user can see what they're about to do. Also please make the padding between the panels consistent. I would like for the square of clickable area to be a lighter shade of whatever the background color is so that it's visible but not too intrusive.

Let's enhance the visual feedback and panel movement. We'll update both App and Panel components:
Key changes made:
Added visual panel movement during drag
Enhanced border styling during drag state:
Solid border instead of dashed
Primary color instead of muted
Thicker border (4px vs 2px)
Added z-index during drag to ensure panel stays on top
Added consistent 8px (2rem) padding between panels
Added subtle background color to clickable area (accent/5 = 5% opacity)
Added hover state for clickable area
Added shadow during drag state
Improved transition animations
The panels should now:
Follow the cursor while dragging
Have clear visual feedback during drag
Have consistent spacing
Show subtle but visible clickable areas
Have smooth transitions between states
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the colors, spacing, or animations!
Please make it so that I don't have to worry about highlighting the text while I'm dragging. This is affecting the usability of the website. While I'm dragging a panel, there should be no text being highlighted on the page.

Let's prevent text selection during dragging by adding user-select styles. We'll update both components:
Key changes made:
Added select-none class to prevent text selection:
On the root container when dragging
On the panel being dragged
On all panel content
Added drag state management to App component
Added drag callbacks to coordinate between App and Panel
Applied select-none to all interactive elements
This should completely prevent text selection while dragging panels around.
There should be a visual indicator where I'm about to release my panel so that I can see where I'm gonna put it. Also, the animation is choppy, while I'm dragging the parent holder shouldn't be an immediate switch. The panel should keep following my Cursor until I release, and then it should smoothly fall into the place I have selected. The other panels should also glide slowly into their new positions that are calculated accordingly.

Let's improve the drag animation and add a visual indicator for the drop target. We'll update both components:
Key changes made:
Added drop zone indicators that appear when dragging
Made panels follow cursor until released
Added smooth transitions for panel repositioning
Added scale effect while dragging
Improved position calculation based on cursor location
Added visual feedback for drop targets
Made transitions smoother with ease-in-out
Separated dragging movement from position transitions
The panels should now:
Follow the cursor smoothly while dragging
Show where they will be dropped
Transition smoothly to their new positions
Have other panels smoothly animate to their new positions
Provide clear visual feedback during dragging
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the animations or behavior!
I want it so that if I'm dragging a small panel into a big spot, that while I'm still holding the panel with my Cursor clicked down the panel will to fill the spot that I'm about to put it in. Also, I want the other panels to move into their positions while I'm still hovering the panel I'm moving so that I can see what I'm about to change before I release the mouse. I want the op of the position where I'm about to put my panel to change as a visual indicator of my panels destination

Let's update the components to provide better visual feedback during dragging. We'll make panels preview their new positions and sizes while dragging:
Key changes made:
Added preview layout state to show potential new positions
Made drop zones semi-transparent with background color
Added size transitions while dragging
Made non-dragged panels move to preview positions
Added opacity to dragged panel
Improved transition timing for different properties
Added visual scaling for dragged panel
Made drop zones more visible with background color
The panels should now:
Preview their new size while being dragged
Show other panels moving to their new positions in real-time
Have clear drop zone indicators with background color
Smoothly transition between sizes and positions
Provide better visual feedback during dragging
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the animations or visual feedback!
Now it's mostly working, but the animation is fucked up for the tiles that I am not clicking. Sometimes they get stacked on top of each other, which is no good. They should smoothly move into their new positions, accommodating each other and accommodating the panel that you're driving.

Let's fix the animation and stacking issues by improving the layout transitions and z-index handling. We'll update both components:
Key changes made:
Added proper z-index management for panels
Added will-change property for better performance
Improved transition timing function with cubic-bezier
Added z-index to layout state
Made transitions more consistent across panels
Added hardware acceleration hints
Improved animation timing coordination
The panels should now:
Move smoothly without stacking
Maintain proper layering during transitions
Have smoother animations
Properly coordinate their movements
Have better performance during transitions
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the animation timing or behavior!
I think the problem is with the way that the panels are shrinking. I want the panels to shrink on all sides coming towards the center rather than the top left corner, adjusting to make the change. Also make the panel shrink before they're in their new position simultaneously with the gliding animation.

Let's modify the animation behavior to make panels shrink/expand from their center and coordinate the timing of size changes with position changes. We'll update both components:
Key changes made:
Added transformOrigin: 'center' to all panels
Coordinated size and position transitions
Added scale transitions for smoother size changes
Made panels shrink/expand from their center
Improved drop zone indicator animations
Added origin-center to all transitioning elements
Adjusted timing of size and position changes
The panels should now:
Shrink/expand from their center point
Change size while moving to new positions
Have smoother, more coordinated animations
Maintain their relative positions during transitions
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the animation timing or behavior!
You're getting there, but I want the animations to be centered. That is to say I don't want stuff growing from the corners, I want it to grow from the middle. Same goes for the shrinking.

Let's modify the panels to grow and shrink from their center by adjusting their positioning and transform origin. We'll update both components:
Key changes made:
Updated panel positioning to use translate transforms from center
Modified drop zone indicators to center align
Added proper transform calculations for each position
4. Used percentage-based positioning for smoother transitions
Adjusted transform origin to center center
Updated position calculations to account for centered growth/shrink
The panels should now:
Grow and shrink from their center point
Move smoothly between positions while maintaining center alignment
Have drop zones that align with the centered panels
Maintain proper spacing during transitions
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the animation timing or positioning!
Everything looks really good now, but you moved the big panel into the fucking middle. Please leave it where it was on the left.

Let's fix the positioning to keep the large panel on the left while maintaining the centered scaling. We'll update both components:
Key changes made:
Removed centered positioning for the left panel
Kept original panel positions while maintaining centered scaling
Updated drop zone indicators to match panel positions
Maintained smooth transitions and animations
Kept transformOrigin centered for scaling effects
The panels should now:
Stay in their original positions
Scale from their centers
Maintain smooth transitions
Keep proper spacing and layout
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the positioning or animations!
That looks good, but the growth is instantaneous, which is not what I want. Please make a quick animation so that the user can see it growing from the middle.

Let's add smooth scaling animations for the size changes. We'll update the Panel component:
Key changes made:
Added scale transform during drag to animate size changes
Added transition property for width and height during drag
Adjusted scale values based on target position (1.5x for small to large, 0.666667x for large to small)
Kept transform origin at center for smooth scaling
Coordinated transitions between dragging and normal states
The panels should now:
1. Smoothly scale up/down when changing sizes
Scale from their center point
Maintain position during scaling
Have coordinated animations with movement
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the animation timing or scaling behavior!
It's getting there, but I don't want the panel to be way bigger than the slot. It's about to drop in. Just slightly bigger.

Let's adjust the scale values to make the size difference more subtle. We'll update the Panel component:
Key changes made:
Changed scale value from 0.666667 to 0.95 for large panel shrinking
Changed scale value from 1.5 to 1.05 for small panel growing
Kept all other animations and transitions the same
The panels should now:
Show a subtle size change when hovering over new positions
Scale down only slightly when moving to a smaller slot
Scale up only slightly when moving to a larger slot
Maintain smooth transitions
Let me know if you'd like the scale values adjusted further!
The sizing is better now, but when I take the top right panel and move it in the left position, the panel that was in the left, move to the bottom right even though that there's a panel there there should be some logic for the panel so that when it's moving to a new position, it can't move to somewhere that's occupied when I take the top right panel and move it to the left Phillip half the screen the panel that's on the left should shrink and move to the top right.

Let's fix the panel movement logic to ensure panels move to unoccupied positions. We'll update the App component:
Key changes made:
Added logic to detect currently occupied positions
Implemented direct panel swapping instead of circular movement
Preserved positions of uninvolved panels
4. Updated preview layout calculation to match new movement logic
Added proper width calculations for swapped panels
Maintained z-index and transform origin settings
The panels should now:
Swap positions directly with the panel they're replacing
Keep uninvolved panels in their current positions
Maintain proper sizing when swapping
Show correct preview animations
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the movement behavior!
I want it so that the panels that you are not moving don't have a shrinking animation. They just changed size and slide into place. The panel you are moving yourself should have the animation which is working properly already so don't change that.

Let's modify the App component to handle animations differently for the dragged panel versus the other panels:
Key changes made:
Added isMoving flag to track which panel is being dragged
Removed transition classes for non-dragged panels
Maintained animations only for the dragged panel
Added conditional transition class based on isMoving flag
The panels should now:
1. Only show scaling animation for the dragged panel
Have instant size changes for other panels
Maintain smooth position transitions for all panels
Keep the dragging behavior the same
