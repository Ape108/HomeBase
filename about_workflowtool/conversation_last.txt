I want to build a web app that will allow me to keep organized while I'm working on my essay. There should be a main page, with an empty template. I'm imagining that on the left of the page, there would be a big panel, with a dotted outline and a plus in the middle. When you click on the empty panel, it would prompt you to link a google docs document. After you link it, where the outline was, your document should be there, sized appropriately. And when you click on it, it should open a new tab in the browser with your essay. On the right side of the page, there sohuld be a similar outline occupying the upper right-hand corner of the page, and it should be for the outline paper you're using for your essay. Below that, in the bottom right corner, there should be an outine where you can attach whatever you want, which might be relevant to your work. My vision for this web app is to create a home base for your essay writing which will streamline and facilitate the process. I want everything to be dark gray or black, the dotted outlines to be a lighter gray, and the web app should be minimal.

I'll help you create a minimal, dark-themed essay organization web app. Let's break this down into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. We'll use Google Docs API for document integration.
First, let's create the basic structure and styling:
Here's the styling to create the dark, minimal theme:
And here's the basic JavaScript to handle Google Docs integration:
To make this work, you'll need to:
Set up a Google Cloud Project
Enable the Google Drive API
Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_API_KEY in the JavaScript file with your actual credentials
The app will need additional features to:
Handle the Google Drive file picker
Display document previews
Save and restore user's document links
Handle error states
Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or add any specific functionality?
how do you want me to configure the google drive API specifically?

I'll guide you through setting up the Google Drive API for your essay workspace app:
First, go to the Google Cloud Console
Create a new project:
Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page
Click "New Project"
Name it something like "Essay Workspace"
Click "Create"
Enable the necessary APIs:
In the left sidebar, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
Search for and enable these APIs:
Google Drive API
Google Picker API
Google Docs API
Set up OAuth consent screen:
Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
Choose "External" user type (unless you're using Google Workspace)
Fill in the required fields:
App name: "Essay Workspace"
User support email: your email
Developer contact email: your email
Add these scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
Add your test users (your Google account email)
Create credentials:
Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
Choose "Web application"
Name: "Essay Workspace Web Client"
Add authorized JavaScript origins:
http://localhost:3000 (for development)
Your production URL when you deploy
Add authorized redirect URIs:
http://localhost:3000
Your production URL when you deploy
Create an API key:
Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
Restrict the API key to only the APIs you're using
Update your app.js with the new credentials:
Update your index.html to include the Google Picker API:
Important Security Notes:
Store your API key and Client ID securely in production
Set up proper API key restrictions in the Google Cloud Console
Add only the domains you're using to the authorized origins
Keep your scopes minimal - only request the permissions you need
For local development:
You'll need to serve your app using a local server (don't just open the HTML file)
You can use something like python -m http.server 3000 or Node.js with http-server
Access your app at http://localhost:3000
Would you like me to explain how to implement the Google Picker API next, or would you like to test the configuration first?
how do I know what my production url will be when I deploy?

The production URL depends on where and how you plan to deploy your application. Here are some common deployment options and their typical URLs:
GitHub Pages
If you deploy through GitHub Pages, your URL will be:
https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name (for project sites)
https://yourusername.github.io (for user/organization sites)
Netlify
When you deploy to Netlify, you get a default URL like:
https://your-site-name.netlify.app
You can also set up a custom domain
Vercel
Default URL format:
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
Also supports custom domains
Custom Domain
If you plan to use your own domain, it would be something like:
https://yourdomain.com
https://app.yourdomain.com
For now, you can:
Start with just http://localhost:3000 for development
Add your production URL later when you decide on hosting
Update the Google Cloud Console settings when you deploy
To update the authorized origins and redirect URIs later:
Go to Google Cloud Console
Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
Add your production URL to both:
Authorized JavaScript origins
Authorized redirect URIs
Would you like me to explain any specific deployment option in more detail?
can you please put my sensitive keys and credentials in a .env file so I can push this to github

I'll help you set up environment variables for your sensitive credentials. First, let's create a .env file and modify the app.js to use it.
Create a new file called .env:
Create a .gitignore file to prevent the .env file from being pushed to GitHub:
Update your app.js to use environment variables:
To make environment variables work in the browser, you'll need to set up a development server. The easiest way is to use something like Vite. First, initialize a new npm project:
dotenv
Create a vite.config.js file:
Update your package.json scripts:
Now you can run your app locally with:
dev
When deploying:
Never commit the .env file to GitHub
Set up environment variables in your deployment platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
Create a .env.example file with dummy values to show other developers what environment variables are needed:
Would you like me to explain how to set up environment variables in any specific deployment platform?
I like the look. Can you please use shadcn to make the components?

I'll help you integrate Shadcn UI components into your project. First, we need to set up Shadcn UI with Vite and React, as Shadcn is built on React.
First, let's update your project to use React and install necessary dependencies:
init
Update your vite.config.js:
Create a new src directory and move your files into it. Let's update the main component:
Create a new entry point:
Update your index.html:
Move your Google API logic to a separate service file:
Install additional required dependencies:
merge
The new structure uses Shadcn's components with a dark theme by default. The styling is now handled through Tailwind CSS classes, and the components have a more modern, polished look while maintaining your minimal aesthetic.
Would you like me to explain any part of the new setup or add any specific Shadcn components?
I got this error.

Let's fix the shadcn-ui installation error. The correct way to install shadcn-ui is to first install it globally, then initialize it in your project. Here's the step-by-step process:
First, install shadcn-ui globally:
ui
Then, install additional required dependencies:
react
Initialize shadcn-ui in your project:
init
When prompted during initialization, choose these options:
Would you like to use TypeScript? › No
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › src/globals.css
Do you want to use CSS variables? › Yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components? › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils? › @/lib/utils
Create the required directories:
lib
Add the components you need:
card
This should resolve the installation error and set up shadcn-ui correctly in your project. Would you like me to show you how to add any specific components or make other adjustments to your setup?
Now this

Let's try a different approach to install shadcn-ui. The error suggests there might be an issue with the global installation. Instead, let's install it directly in your project using the CLI tool.
First, install the CLI tool as a dev dependency:
ui
Then run the init command:
init
If you're still getting the error, let's try the manual installation process:
First, create a tailwind.config.js file:
Create a src/lib/utils.js file:
Create or update src/globals.css:
Update your package.json scripts to include PostCSS:
After setting these up, you should be able to use the shadcn components in your App.jsx file. Would you like me to show you how to add specific components like the Button and Card components next?
What's the problem?

The issue seems to be with the shadcn-ui installation. Let's fix this by:
First, remove the current @shadcn/ui installation:
ui
Install all the required dependencies first:
react
Initialize Tailwind CSS:
p
Then try installing shadcn-ui using the CLI tool:
init
This alternative command should work better than the previous one. When prompted during the initialization:
Choose "No" for TypeScript
Choose "Default" for style
Choose "Slate" for base color
Use "src/globals.css" for global CSS
Choose "Yes" for CSS variables
Use default for tailwind.config.js location
Use "@/components" for components import alias
Use "@/lib/utils" for utils import alias
After this is done, you can add the components:
card
The error you're seeing suggests that the shadcn-ui command isn't being recognized properly. Using create-shadcn-ui instead should resolve this issue. Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process?
Now I get this error

Let's try a different approach. The package name has changed. Here's the correct installation command:
npm
Then, install the shadcn-ui components manually:
First, install React and Vite React plugin if not already installed:
react
Install the component dependencies:
authority
Create the Button component. Create a new file at src/components/ui/button.jsx:
Create the Card component. Create a new file at src/components/ui/card.jsx:
Now you should be able to use these components in your App.jsx. Would you like me to show you how to update your App.jsx to use these components?
I did all of that. What do I need to do now?

Now we need to update your App.jsx to use the new shadcn components and move the Google API logic into a proper React structure. Here's the updated App.jsx:
You can now:
Delete the old app.js and styles.css files as they're no longer needed
Run the development server:
dev
The app should now show up with the shadcn components and dark theme. You should see:
A large panel on the left for the essay
Two smaller panels on the right for outline and resources
All panels should have a plus icon and hover effects
The Google API integration should work when clicking on the panels
Would you like me to explain any part of the new structure or help with implementing the Google Picker API next?
I got this issue when I ran the development server. I think that the problem is being caused because there is a folder called my-app which has some of the files. This needs to be resolved, please fix the structure of the directories for this project.

Let's fix the project structure. First, let's install the missing dotenv package:
dotenv
Now, here's the correct directory structure you should have:
js
You can delete:
The my-app directory if it exists
app.js (since we've moved the logic to React components)
styles.css (since we're using globals.css)
To fix this:
Make sure you're in the root WorkflowTool directory
Move any files from my-app to the correct locations in the structure above
Delete the my-app directory
You can use these commands to create the correct structure:
install
Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this restructuring?
can you do that for me?

I'll help you clean up the project structure. First, let's remove the old files since we've moved to React:
css
Now your project structure should look like this:
js
Let's also make sure all dependencies are installed:
path
Now try running the development server again:
dev
If you're still having issues, let me know what error you're seeing and I can help troubleshoot further. Would you like me to show you how to move any specific files or make other adjustments to the structure?

I see the issue. You're mixing Next.js and Vite configurations. Let's fix this by choosing Vite since that's what we started with. Here's how to fix it:
First, update your package.json to use Vite instead of Next.js:
Create a postcss.config.js file:
Delete any Next.js specific files and folders:
next
Install the updated dependencies:
install
Make sure your project structure looks like this:
js
You can now delete app.js and styles.css as they're no longer needed:
css
Now try running the development server again:
dev
This should resolve the build error and get your Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn setup working properly. Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
I got this issue

The error is because we need to install dotenv. Let's fix this by:
Install dotenv as a dev dependency:
dotenv
Update the vite.config.js to use dotenv in a way that's compatible with ES modules:
Also, since we've moved to React, we can delete app.js as its functionality has been moved to App.jsx:
js
Update your package.json to include dotenv:
Now try running the development server again:
dev
This should resolve the dotenv error. Would you like me to explain any part of these changes?
Now this

The error is coming from the tailwind.config.js file because we're using ES modules but the config is in CommonJS format. Let's update the tailwind.config.js to use ES module syntax:
The main changes are:
Removed module.exports = and replaced it with export default
Kept the rest of the configuration the same
Now try running the development server again:
dev
This should resolve the module error you're seeing. Would you like me to explain any part of this change?
Now I have a blank screen with only the text. What happened? Make it look like it did when we first ran it.

The issue is that we need to import the CSS files in your main.jsx and update the index.html. Here's how to fix it:
Update src/main.jsx:
Update index.html to include the dark theme by default:
You can now delete app.js and styles.css since we've moved to React components:
css
The dark theme and styling should now be working. You should see:
A dark background
Three panels with dashed borders
Plus icons in each panel
Hover effects on the panels
Let me know if you need any adjustments to the styling!
Nothing changed.

Let's fix this by ensuring all the necessary files are properly set up and connected. The most important part is making sure the CSS is properly imported.
First, let's update src/main.jsx:
Make sure your src/globals.css has all the Tailwind directives at the top:
Update your tailwind.config.js to include the correct paths:
Delete the old files if you haven't already:
css
Now restart your development server:
dev
You should now see the dark theme and proper styling. Let me know if you need any adjustments
